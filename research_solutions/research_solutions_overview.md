# Research Solutions

## The hackathon submissions will be open to individuals across career levels and trajectories, with the intention of addressing specific barriers, such as:

1. Development of guidelines and best practices for culturally-sensitive and ethical research practices.
2. Increased representation and visibility of African populations in neuroscience research.
3. Educational open discussions and knowledge sharing.
4. Platform development for data sharing, computing, and brain data analysis.
5. Collaborative solutions mitigating connectivity and communication constraints between scientists.
