# Hackathon
Open (Data) Science Neuro Hackathon

The two week program bridges interdisciplinary topics such as neuroscience, data science, ethics, and open access frameworks. Attendees will receive hands-on instruction and problem-solving experience by developing novel hackathon solutions. The course is Python-intensive and lectures will introduce neuroimaging data preparation, processing, and modeling. Attendees may present their solutions to their peers in a knowledge sharing environment.

## Acknowledgements
This project is made possible through the support of multiple collaborative partners. I would like to extend my gratitude to my mentor Juliet Davidow and the support of the Learning and Brain Development Lab for guidance on the vision. I am grateful to TReND in Africa for cultivating and facilitating the partnership with Lilongwe University for Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR). The in-person workshop is coordinated with the support of Agriculture and Policy Analysis at LUANAR, and I extend my warm thank you to the organization for the collaboration. The hackathon is made possible through the collaborative support of Black In Neuro and contributions from Meta Reality Labs. I would also like to thank the Center for Emerging Markets at Northeastern University for the support as a recipient of the Srinivasan Award that was able to facilitate the project.
