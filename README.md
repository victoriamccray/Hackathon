# Hackathon
Open Science Neuro Hackathon and Workshop

The primary aim of this project is to offer a hackathon that addresses research challenges for neuroscientists of the African diaspora. The project facilitates the development of open-source and community-based research tools that can alleviate financial burdens for neuroscientists. The aims of the project are to increase access to neuroimaging technology and open-source analytical techniques on the African continent and globally, where scientists face challenges in these resources. Moreover, STEM fields broadly lack diverse and inclusive outreach for underrepresented, historically marginalized and underfunded communities.

# Workshop

Computational Neuroscience Hackathon: Python for Neuroimaging Data

*Instructor/Facilitator: Victoria McCray, M.S. Candidate in Bioinformatics*

*Duration: 2-4 Weeks*
<br>*Location: TBD*
*Dates: TBD (November 2024 - Jan 2025)*


This workshop aims to equip participants with the skills necessary to contribute to open-source neuroscience projects using Python and GitHub. Attendees will learn how to navigate open-source collaboration, use Python for neuroscientific analysis, and contribute to existing projects on GitHub. This workshop is designed for students, researchers, and professionals in neuroscience who are interested in open-source collaboration and programming knowledge in Python and GitHub. 

## Agenda

### 1. Introduction to Python for Data Analysis
- Learning data types, syntax and structures for programming in Python
- Principles for data visualization, data pipelines, and handling large datasets efficiently
- Introduction to exploratory analysis and statistical analysis techniques using Python
- Exposure to standard libraries for data processing like NumPy, Matplotlib and Pandas

### 2. Introduction to Open Source and Collaborative Coding with GitHub
- Navigating and configuring GitHub/Git platforms
- Forking and cloning code repositories
- Making contributions to code through pull requests

### 3. Neuroscience Applications
- Open-source libraries for neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and neuroinformatics
- Exploring applications with libraries like nibabel, open ephys, and/or nilearn
- Signal processing using Python for EEG and fMRI data

### 4. Contributing to Open-Source Projects
- Understanding the principles and best practices for open-source collaboration
- Identifying beginner-friendly open-source projects in neuroscience
- Hands-on guidance for making contributions

### Key Takeaways
- Understanding of open-source principles and collaborative workflows
- Proficiency in using Python for neuroscientific analysis
- Practical experience in contributing to open-source projects on GitHub
- Insight into real-world applications of Python in neuroscience
