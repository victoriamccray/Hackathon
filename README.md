# Hackathon
Open Science Neuro Hackathon

The two week program bridges interdisciplinary topics such as neuroscience, data science, ethics, and open access frameworks. Attendees will receive hands-on instruction and problem-solving experience by developing novel hackathon solutions. The course is Python-intensive and lectures will introduce neuroimaging data preparation, processing, and modeling. Attendees may present their solutions to their peers in a knowledge sharing environment.

# Short Course

Computational Neuroscience Hackathon: Python for Neuroimaging Data

*Facilitators:
<br>Victoria McCray
<br>Najja Marshall
<br>Eberechi Wogu
<br>Elizabeth Bandason
<br>Dennis Makwakwa*

<br>*Location: Lilongwe University for Agriculture and Natural Resources*
*Dates: Feb 10 - 21, 2025*


This workshop aims to equip participants with the skills necessary to contribute to open-source neuroscience projects using Python and GitHub. Attendees will learn how to navigate open-source collaboration, use Python for neuroscientific analysis, and contribute to existing projects on GitHub. This workshop is designed for students, researchers, and professionals in neuroscience who are interested in open-source collaboration and programming knowledge in Python and GitHub.
