# Open (Data) Science Neuro Hackathon

The two week program bridges interdisciplinary topics such as neuroscience, data science, ethics, and open access frameworks. Attendees will receive hands-on instruction and problem-solving experience by developing novel hackathon solutions. The course is Python-intensive and lectures will introduce neuroimaging data preparation, processing, and modeling. Attendees may present their solutions to their peers in a knowledge sharing environment.
