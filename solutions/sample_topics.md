# Sample Solution Topics

## Aims
Build a data science application for one of the following using data from biological systems (biotechnology, neuroimaging, food and agriculture, etc):
- Conduct a novel exploratory analysis to generate and test your hypothesis
- Automate an existing analysis, validate assumptions, and evaluate outcomes
- Build a machine learning algorithm or model (using a proper workflow for preparing, modeling, and evaluating the - - algorithm)
- Improve the usability of an existing package, platform, or framework with novel contributions

### Methods for Improving Ethics and Bias Challenges
1. Development of guidelines and best practices for culturally-sensitive and ethical research practices.
2. Increased representation and visibility of African populations in neuroscience research.
3. Educational open discussions and knowledge sharing.
4. Platform development for data sharing, computing, and brain data analysis.
5. Collaborative solutions mitigating connectivity and communication constraints between scientists.

## Tips for Collaborating
- Conduct code reviews for readability, logic checks, test cases, and technical support for each others work
- Document code with comments and markdown
- Communicate technical challenges/goals using natural languages
- Leverage official documentation, code samples from tutorials, and previous literature
- Limit use of Gen AI (ie. ChatGPT, Copilot) so you can better practice and learn
- Try your best, but don't spin your wheels! Reach out to others for help when you get stuck

## Criteria
- Solution is expected to be developed in primarily Python
- You may use other languages to support (R, SQL, bash, etc)
- Conduct a thorough analysis of inferential, ethical, and technical limitations
- Identify biases in data collection, exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and/or evaluation

### Additional Expectations
- You may form groups of up to 4 or work individually
- Everyone must contribute equally in terms of code and interpretation
- Presentations will be Fri for 15 mins total + 5 mins for questions
- Share code with the group via GitHub for review (either via hackathon repo pull request or your own)
- Check in with Victoria + Dennis daily (at least ~10 mins) for feedback and support


**Note:** Please cite if you borrow more than ~3 lines of code from others
