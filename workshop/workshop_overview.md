## Open Science Neuro Hackathon

The two-week program bridges interdisciplinary topics such as neuroscience, data science, ethics, and open access frameworks. Attendees will receive hands-on instruction and problem-solving experience by developing novel hackathon solutions. The course is Python-intensive and lectures will introduce neuroimaging data preparation, processing, and modeling. Attendees may present their solutions to their peers in a knowledge-sharing environment.

**Dates**: Feb 10 - 21, 2025

**Schedule**

Week One will focus on introductory and foundational learnings related to the human nervous system, coding in Python, and ethical problems within research and machine learning. This week may also introduce the hackathon framework.

Week Two will feature case study applications from guest speakers, hands-on activities, and dedicated time to develop and present novel solutions for the hackathon.
